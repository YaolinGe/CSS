# CSS notes
- I should use `my-file.html` instead of `my_file.html` to optimize for Google Search Engine.
- Browser reads code from top to bottom, so javascript should be in the bottom if it needs to affect the title in the top.
- `fix` to fix the background image even though I am scrolling.
- `scroll` to let it scroll so that I can move away it.
- `max-width` is used to make sure the browser has the compatible scrolling when it is small screen size.
`direction: rtl;` to change the direction from right to left.
`unicode-bidi: bidi-override` to start from the opposite direction of reading text.
`text-decoration` can be used to highlight some texts here and there.
`text-transform` to transform all letters to uppercase or lowercase.
`white-space: nowrap` to remove auto wrapping so the line gets extremely long.
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sofia&effect=fire">` can add fire effect to the font.
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sofia&effect=neon|outline|emboss|shadow-multiple">` can separate several effects.
